Uses several optimization tactics to simulate Diffusion Limited Aggregation with Pygame.

Coded in Python, all settings can be changed in the file 'config.cfg'. Keep the field 'set-random-seed' blank if you wish to generate a new fractal each time.

It is necessay to have Pygame installed to execute this code. See the pygame documentation for install instructions.
